    Vishi is Distinctive artist like a hurricane where she can cause devastation by her wild strokes and she is capable to create a sanctuary by softer strokes as well. She is blessed with a vision, which can reflect back the rainbows during stormy rains. She is confined of expression, radiance and divinity. Whenever she hawk over the blank canvas on her easel accompanied by color containers and brushes. Her hands twitch to reach out to them for the sake of art. She says Art is omnipresent, we just have to look with eye full of color.
She is a MBA (HR) with a diploma in ARTS but ART is what she breathe, seek and endure.
